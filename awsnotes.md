What have we learnt so far...

IAM is universal.

The root account is the first account created when first setup your AWS account it has full access to anything.

New users have NO PERMISSIONS when first created

New users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys are not the same as the password

Always setup MFA on your root account
